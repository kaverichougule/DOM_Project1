# DOM Manipulation

I have created an HTML file that includes a 'div' element with the ID "div1." <br>
I link an external JavaScript file, "script.js," using the 'script' tag. This JavaScript file is responsible for modifying the styles of the "div1" element.<br>
In "script.js," I use the getElementById method to select the "div1" element by its ID. <br>
I then use the style property to set various CSS styles for the selected element. These styles include the background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, width, and text color.
